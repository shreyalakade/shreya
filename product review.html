        Sunscreen Product Review by Meg,
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        “Firstly, I have to admit that sunscreen hasn’t always been a part of my routine. You see, I love being tanned. While I know that you can still tan while wearing sunblock, the old me just didn’t believe it. But now, the new, wiser and ageing me will not leave home without it!  I’m even paranoid driving in my car without sunblock. Given the fact that almost all the people I see in the clinic have more sun damage on the right side of their face than their left, I think I’m right to be paranoid.</p> 
      <p class="para">  Luckily, most skin care companies now make sunblock much nicer to wear. Long gone are the thick, greasy zincs that were available when I was growing up. SPF is now in our moisturisers and they feel luxurious on and can be worn under makeup without it slipping off half way through the morning.</p>

<p class="para">So what is my favourite?  Well I have tried a few, such as Osmosis Protect, Cosmedix Hydrate + and Aspects Hydra Shield. But what I am using now and really enjoying is the <a href="https://aspectskincare.com/" target="-blank">Aspect Sun Envirostat Face</a>. I’m using this one at the moment because I took it away with me last week when I was in a hotter climate and was going to be spending time swimming at the beach. 
<a href="https://aspectskincare.com/products/envirostat-face-spf50#:~:text=Aspect%20Sun%20Envirostat%C2%AE%20Face%20SPF%2050%2B%20is%20a%20very,t%20leave%20a%20white%20residue" target="-blank">Aspect Sun Envirostat Face is SPF 50</a>, 4 hours water resistant and also a daily moisturiser.</p>
<p class="para">It contains antioxidants and Vitamin E to help fight damage from UV exposure and aloe vera to deeply moisturise. It dries straight away and looks good under makeup. Actually, I think that my makeup goes on a lot better after applying this. The packaging is lovely and easy to use and it has a pleasant smell to it. Also, of course, because we are super fussy about which brands we stock, it contains no toxic chemicals or other hidden nasties. I also used it on my kids while we were away!
I think that over the warmer months I will keep using this one, and go back to using a zinc based sunblock in the cooler months.”
